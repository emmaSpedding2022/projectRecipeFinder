# ProjectRecipeFinder
The user can enter an ingredient, if they enter something that there is no recipe for then they will be asked for another ingredient 

Once 15 recipes have been returned, the user can then filter by the amount of calories and the time they have available for cooking 

If the user filters and there are no matching results they are asked to increase the calories and / or change the time they have available and the filter is re run 

A list of recipes that are available for the search are returned
